-> Introduction  
   -> In this lesson, you will dive into dynamic routes, an essential concept in Flask for creating web pages that adapt based on the data provided in the URL  
   -> Dynamic routes enable you to pass variables from the URL directly into your view functions, allowing for more flexible and interactive web applications  
   -> The concept is commonly used for things like user profiles, product pages, or blog posts, where the content changes based on the identifier in the URL  

-> What are Dynamic Routes?  
   -> Dynamic routes allow parts of the URL path to be treated as variables that you can use in your code  
   -> This is useful for scenarios where multiple pages share a similar structure but display different content based on a unique identifier  
   -> For example:  
      -> `www.example.com/user/random_guy`  
      -> `www.example.com/user/someones_grandma`  
      -> `www.example.com/user/Tom`  
   -> All these URLs follow a similar pattern (`/user/<username>`) but dynamically load content based on the specific `username` in the URL  
   -> In Flask, dynamic components are denoted by surrounding the variable part of the path with angle brackets (`< >`)  
   -> The dynamic part of the path is passed as a parameter to the corresponding view function  

-> How to Code Dynamic Routes  
   -> To define a dynamic route, use the `@app.route()` decorator with angle brackets to specify the dynamic part of the URL  
   -> Example:  
     ```python  
     @app.route('/user/<username>')  
     def user(username):  
         return f"Hello, {username}!"  
     ```  
   -> In this example:  
      -> When a user visits `localhost:5000/user/Tom`, Flask captures the `Tom` part of the URL and passes it as the `username` parameter to the `user()` function  
      -> The function then processes the `username` and returns a personalized message, `"Hello, Tom!"`  
   -> This process allows the same route (`/user/<username>`) to dynamically handle different content based on the URL parameter  

-> Understanding Dynamic Path Components  
   -> In Flask, you can define dynamic paths that accept different types of variables  
   -> The dynamic part of the URL is the content placed within the angle brackets  
   -> For example:  
     -> `/user/<username>` captures a string as `username`  
     -> `/post/<int:post_id>` captures an integer as `post_id`  
     -> Flask can automatically convert the URL segment into the specified type, such as a string, integer, float, or path  
   -> Flask supports the following converters:  
      -> `<string:name>`: Matches any string (excluding slashes)  
      -> `<int:id>`: Matches an integer  
      -> `<float:price>`: Matches a floating-point number  
      -> `<path:filename>`: Matches a path, including slashes  

-> Example of Dynamic Routes with Different Converters  
   -> You can define routes that capture different types of data using Flask’s built-in converters  
   -> Example with an integer converter:  
     ```python  
     @app.route('/post/<int:post_id>')  
     def show_post(post_id):  
         return f"Displaying post {post_id}"  
     ```  
   -> In this example, Flask expects an integer for `post_id` and will pass that value to the `show_post()` function  
   -> Example with a path converter:  
     ```python  
     @app.route('/files/<path:filename>')  
     def download_file(filename):  
         return f"Downloading file: {filename}"  
     ```  
   -> This route handles URLs like `/files/images/photo.jpg` and passes the full path (`images/photo.jpg`) to the `download_file()` function  

-> Learn by Doing  
   -> Now try creating dynamic routes based on the following suggestions to practice:  
      -> Create a route that accepts two dynamic arguments (e.g., `name` and `age`), then displays a message with both parameters  
        Example: `/greet/<name>/<int:age>`  
      -> Create a route that accepts a numeric argument (e.g., a post ID) and returns the square of that number  
        Example: `/square/<int:number>`  
      -> Experiment with spaces in dynamic arguments (Flask automatically handles URL encoding, so spaces will be replaced with `%20` in the URL)  

-> Example Code for Multiple Dynamic Arguments  
   -> Here’s an example of how to handle two dynamic arguments in a single route  
     ```python  
     @app.route('/user/<name>/<int:age>')  
     def user_info(name, age):  
         return f"User: {name}, Age: {age}"  
     ```  
   -> In this example, when you visit `localhost:5000/user/Tom/25`, the response will be `"User: Tom, Age: 25"`  

-> Summary: Python Flask Dynamic Routes  
   -> Dynamic routes allow you to create flexible URLs that capture parts of the path as variables  
   -> These variables are passed to view functions, enabling you to generate dynamic content based on the URL  
   -> To define a dynamic route, use `@app.route()` with angle brackets around the dynamic part of the path  
   -> Flask supports different types of dynamic path components, including `string`, `int`, `float`, and `path` converters  
   -> Example code for dynamic route with a string argument:  
     ```python  
     @app.route('/user/<username>')  
     def user(username):  
         return f"Hello, {username}!"  
     ```  
   -> Dynamic routes are useful for creating pages like user profiles, product pages, or posts that change based on the parameters in the URL
