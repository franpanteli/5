-> 5) Build Your First Flask Apps Lesson  
-> Lab: Make Your Own Routes  
-> 3 min to complete  
-> By Brandon Gigous  

-> Alright Flask cadet, it's time for your first mission  
-> If you choose to accept, your mission is to define three routes in your Flask application  

-> Learn by Doing  
-> 1. The first route shall be for an "about" page that was shown in the last lesson  
-> This page should provide some content that gives visitors information about you or the website  
-> For this lab, write a blurb about either:  
   -> (a) what you hope to get out of this course, or  
   -> (b) a mini bio of yourself  
-> This route will help you get familiar with returning simple HTML content from a view function  

-> 2. The second route shall be for a page that lists your favorite songs  
-> This page should showcase a list of songs you enjoy  
-> Use some basic HTML elements to make it look somewhat pretty!  
-> Consider using the following tags:  
   -> <ul> (unordered list)  
   -> <li> (list item)  
   -> <strong> (for strong emphasis)  
   -> <em> (for emphasis)  
   -> Add some header tags like <h2> and <h3> to introduce sections or make parts of your list stand out  
-> Experiment with styling to make the page visually appealing, and make sure to test the route to ensure it displays correctly  

-> 3. The third route shall be for a page that has a link to the two other pages set forth above  
-> This page will serve as a navigation hub, allowing users to easily access both the "about" page and the "favorite songs" page  
-> On this page, create a link to both the `/about` and `/songs` routes using the <a> tag  
-> Your link will be in the form:  
   -> <a href="/about">About Page</a>  
   -> <a href="/songs">Favorite Songs Page</a>  
-> This route will teach you how to link different pages in your Flask app, providing a simple navigation experience for users  

-> If you haven't already, now's a good time to make your first <a> tag  
-> The <a> tag allows users to click on a link and navigate to another page within your Flask app  

-> <li> <strong> <em> <h2> <h3>  
-> These HTML tags will enhance the readability and presentation of your routes' content  

-> Once you've defined your routes and tested them, commit your changes using git  
-> Make sure your Flask application is running and accessible through your local server at `http://localhost:5000/`  

-> git commit  
-> After completing this lab, you will have hands-on experience with defining and linking multiple routes in Flask, as well as a better understanding of how to manage navigation between different pages in a web application
